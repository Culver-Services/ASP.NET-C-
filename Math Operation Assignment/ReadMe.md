Assignment

Create a console application that does the following:

1. Takes an input from the user, multiplies it by 50, and prints the result to the console.
Note: make sure your code can take inputs larger than 10,000,000.

2. Takes an input from the user, adds 25 to it, and prints the result to the console.

3. Takes an input from the user, divides it by 12.5, and prints the result to the console.

4. Takes an input from the user, checks if it is greater than 50, and prints the true/false result to the console.

5. Takes an input from the user, divides it by 7, and prints the remainder to the console (tip: think % operator).
